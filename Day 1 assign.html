<h2>Dear Vikram and Dimple,
    </h2>
    <h3>
        <pre>
            Distance is not a barrier between two people when their souls are unified.Vikram and Dimple, 
            you both justified your long distance relationship with ease.I can't remember a love story that
            hit me hard in recent times. Your love story taught me the definition of pure love. I assure you
            that, everybody would crave for a love story like yours. It's immense and authentic.
        </pre>

            Vikram, you did everything to make Dimple feel special. The way you proposed her with flowers on the 
            road,the way you held her dupatta while doing parikrama and the way you used your blood as a vermillion 
            on her forehead. It may look dramatic, but you have done all these cute gestures to express your immense 
            love towards Dimple.You have Dimple's picture on your wallet too . And yes ,Vikram, you were an ideal lover 
            that every girl crave for.
        </pre>

            Dimple, you have a strong heart. You are the reason for Captain Vikram Batra's successful career. 
            You made him follow his passion. Whenever Vikram comes to meet you, your heart overwhelmed with 
            happinessand your heartbeat gets stuck when he leaves for his duty. I would say that, Dimple you were 
            the biggest strength of Captain Vikram Batra.And kudos to you Dimple for living Vikram's widow till date.

            Literally your tale touched each and everyone's soul. The love and bond you shared was really touching. 
            There are many love stories but your love tale will be embedded forever in my heart.
            People may die, but their love story will live on forever.
        </pre>

            Finally, Thank you @sidmalhotra for showing Vikram Batra's life in reality and making his parents feel
            proud of him and Kudos to @kiaraaliaadvani for showing what true love is. Definitely, Shershah will be 
            remembered ever.!
